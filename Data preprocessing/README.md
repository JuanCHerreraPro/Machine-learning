# Machine-learning
We can make a comparisson between cars and machine learning algorithms, both need somethings that make them works, for cars is the fuel, and in the case of ML algorithms are data. 

But there is not soo simple as put any kind of fuel, we must use gasoline, for data we need to format date in certain way, before even think in the traning process.

<p> These are some of the preprocessing techniques that we will be analyzing: <p>

<ol>
<li>Binarization</li>
<li>Mean removal</li>
<li>Scaling</li>
<li>Normalization</li>
</ol>
