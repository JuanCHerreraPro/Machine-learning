# Correlation heatmaps
"""
    A correlation exists between two features when there is a relationship between
    the different values of the features. 
    If a feature changes consistently in relation to another feature, these features are said to be highly correlated.

    Correlation can be positive (an increase in one value of a feature increases the value
    of the target variable) or negative (an increase in one value of a feature decreases the
    value of the target variable).
